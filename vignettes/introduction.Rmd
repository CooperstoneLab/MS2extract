# Introduction

This vignette has the objective to introduce the **MS2extract** package. The
main goal of this package is to provide a tool to create in-house MS2 compound
libraries. Users can access a specific function help through the command
help(*['function name']*). It is worth to note that this package is aimed in 
the targeted extraction of MS/MS scans and it is not able to perform compound
matching/annotation.

A simplified workflow is presented in Figure 1. Briefly, mzXML files are imported
in memory, then based on metadata provided by the user such as compound chemical
formula, the theoretical m/z of the ionized compound is calculated. Then, product
ion scans that are between a ppm tolerance are extracted.
Furthermore, low intensity signals, or background noise, can be removed
out of the spectra. Finally, users can export the extracted MS/MS spectra to
a msp file format to be used as reference library for further compound
identification and annotation.

# Basic workflow

As previously mentioned, the workflow consist in four main steps:

* data import, 
* extract MS/MS scans,
* detect mass, and 
* export MS/MS library

In this section, we will explain in a more detail the main steps, 
as well as provide information about the required and optional arguments
that users may need to provide in order to properly use this package.


Additionally, this package also includes a set of `batch_*()` functions that
allows to process multiple mzxml files at once. However, more metadata is
required to run this automated pipeline and the use of this `batch_*()` functions
will be described in the
[Using MS2extract Batch Pipeline](https://cooperstonelab.github.io/MS2extract/articles/batch_extract.html).

## Data import

This section is focused on describing how MS2extract package imports MS/MS data.

The main import fuction relies on the newly implemented 
[metID](https://metid.tidymass.org) R package. We adapted the import function in
order to read mass spectrometry data from mzXML files. The new adaptation 
consists in importing scans data in a list (S3 object) rather than into a S4
object, facilitating the downstream tidy analysis of this object.

> This function execute a back-end calculation of theoretical ionized mass
of the compound in order to extract the precursor ions that match that mass
with a given ppm.

The arguments of the `import_mzxml()` functions are four:

* file
* met_metadata
* ppm
* ...

```{r}
# Loading the package
library(MS2extract)


# Print function arg
formals(import_mzxml)
```

### File

File consists in the file name of your mzXML file that contains MS/MS data
of  authentic standards or reference material. Here, we provide an example
file of Procyanidin A2 collected in Negative ionization mode with a collision
energy of 20 eV.


```{r}
# Importing the Spectrum of Procyanidin A2 in negative ionization mode
# and 20 eV as the collision energy
ProcA2_file <- system.file("extdata",
                        "ProcyanidinA2_neg_20eV.mzXML",
                         package = "MS2extract")
# File name
ProcA2_file
```


### met_metadata

This argument refers to the metadata that user need to provide in order to 
properly import scans that are related to the compound of interest.

The `met_metadata` is a data frame that has required and optional columns. The
required columns are employed to calculate the theoretical ionized m/z of a 
given formula in a given ionization mode. In the optional columns, we have the option
to provide the Region Of Interest (ROI) where the compound elutes in order to only
keep this retention time window.

The required columns are:

* **Formula:** A character specifying the metabolite formula
* **Ionization_mode:** The ionization mode employed in data collection. It can be either *Positive* or *Negative*

The optional columns are: 

* **min_rt:** a double with the minimum retention time to keep
* **max_rt:** a double with the minimum retention time to keep


```{r}
# Procyanidin A2 metadata
ProcA2_data <- data.frame(Formula = "C30H24O12",Ionization_mode = "Negative",
                      min_rt = 163, max_rt = 180)
ProcA2_data
```

### ppm

ppm refers to the maximum m/z deviation from the theoretical mass. By
default, 10 ppm is used.


### import_mzxml()


With all arguments explained, we can use the `import_mzxml()` function.


```{r}
# Import Procyanidin A2 data
ProcA2_raw <- import_mzxml(ProcA2_file, met_metadata = ProcA2_data, ppm = 5)

# 24249 rows = ions detected
dim(ProcA2_raw)
```


## Extracting MS/MS spectra

Now that we have the data imported, we con proceed to extract the 
**most intense MS/MS scan** between all scans.

This function computes the MS/MS TIC by summing up all intensities of the MS/MS
spectra and selects the scans with the highest intensity.

This function takes three arguments

* **spec:** the imported MS/MS spectra
* **verbose:** a boolean, if verbose = TRUE, the MS/MS TIC and spectra is printed, if verbose = FALSE, plots are not displayed
* **out_list:** a boolean, if out_list = TRUE, the extracted MS/MS spectra table and plots are returned as list, otherwise only the MS/MS spectra is returned as data frame.

```{r out.width="100%", out.height="100%"}
ProcA2_extracted <- extract_MS2(ProcA2_raw, verbose = TRUE, out_list = FALSE)
```


Here, we can see in the top plot MS/MS tic that the scan colored in red is
the most intense and the MS/MS spectra of that scan will be exported. At
the bottom plot, we can see the Procyanidin A2 MS/MS spectra at rt: 170.667.
The maximum m/z axis value is > 1500 m/z but not significant ions are displayed.
This can be explained due to low intensities are kept in the MS/MS spectra.

```{r}
range(ProcA2_extracted$mz)
```


The range of the MS/MZ m/z value is from 100 m/z to 1699 m/z, but 
intensities are too slow to be seen in the plot.

## Detecting masses

Similarly to the MZmine pipeline, detecting masses refers to set a minimum
signal intensity threshold that ions have to meet in order to be kept in the data. Thus, ion
with lower intensities are removed from the data frame. This function can also
normalize the spectra ion intensity to percentage based on the base peak.

The three required arguments are:

* **spec:** a data frame containing the MS2 spectra.
* **normalize:** a boolean indicating if the MS2 spectra is normalized by he base peak before proceeding to filter out low intensity signals (normalize  = TRUE), if normalize = FALSE the user has to provide the minimum ion count.
* **min_int** an integer refereing to the minimum ion intensity

By default, the normalization is set to `TRUE` and the minimum intensity is 
set to 1% to remove background noise.

```{r}
ProcA2_detected <- detect_mass(ProcA2_extracted, normalize = TRUE, min_int = 1)
```

We can see now the range of m/z values and the maximium value is 576.1221 m/z.

```{r}
range(ProcA2_detected$mz)
```

## MS/MS spectra plot 

We can proceed to plot the clean MS/MS spectra with `plot_MS2spectra()` function.
This is a ggplot2 based function; the blue diamond refers to the precursor ion.

If we take a look to the previous MS/MS plot, there is less background noise
in this MS/MS spectra.

```{r out.width="100%"}
plot_MS2spectra(ProcA2_detected)
```


## Exporting MS/MS spectra

Finally after extracting the MS/MS spectra and removing background noise, we 
can proceed to export the MS2 in a msp format.

For this task, we need extra information about the compound, such as 
SMILES, COLLISIONENERGY, etc.

An example of this table can be found at:

```{r warning=FALSE}
# Reading the metadata
metadata_file <- system.file("extdata",
                             "msp_metadata.csv",
                             package = "MS2extract")

metadata <- read.csv(metadata_file)
dplyr::glimpse(metadata)
```

The precursor ion is not necessary to provide since this information is included
in the extracted MS/MS spectra.


The three arguments for this function are:

* **spec:** a data frame containing the extracted MS2 spectra
* **spec_metadata:** a data frame containing the values to be including in the resulting msp file
* **msp_name:** a string with the name of the msp file not containing (.msp) extension

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
write_msp(spec = ProcA2_detected,
          spec_metadata = metadata,
          msp_name = "Procyanidin_A2")
```


After writing the msp file, you will see the following file content:

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat(write_msp_base(ProcA2_detected, metadata) )
```



# Session info

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
