# Introduction

This vignette has the objective to introduce the **MS2extract**. The
main goal of this package is to provide a tool to create in-house MS2 compound
libraries. Users can access a specific function help through the command
help(*['function name']*). It is worth to note that this package is aimed in 
the targeted extraction of MS/MS scans and it is not able to perform compound
matching/annotation.

A simplified workflow is presented in Figure 1. Briefly, mzXML files are imported
in memory, then based on metadata provided by the user such as compound chemical
formula, and the theoretical precursor *m*/*z* based on the
chemical formula provided by the user in the metadata.Then, product
ion scans are extracted with a given ppm tolerance.
Next, low intensity signals, or background noise, can be removed
from the spectra. Finally, users can export the extracted MS/MS spectra to
a msp file format to be used as reference library for further compound
identification and annotation.

# Basic workflow

The MS2 workflow has four main steps:

* data import, 
* extract MS/MS scans,
* detect masses, and 
* export MS/MS library

In this section, we will explain in a more detail the main steps, 
as well as provide information about the required and optional arguments
that users may need to provide in order to effectively use this package.


Additionally, this package also includes a set of `batch_*()` functions that
allows to process multiple .mzXML files at once. However, more metadata is
required to run this automated pipeline and the use of this `batch_*()` functions
will is described in the
[Using MS2extract Batch Pipeline](https://cooperstonelab.github.io/MS2extract/articles/batch_extract.html).

## Data import

This section is focused on describing how MS2extract package imports MS/MS data.

The main import function relies on R package
[metID](https://metid.tidymass.org). We adapted the import function in
order to read mass spectrometry data from mzXML files. The new adaptation 
consists in importing scans data in a list (S3 object) rather than into a S4
object, facilitating the downstream tidy analysis of this object.

> This function execute a back-end calculation of theoretical ionized *m*/*z*
of the compound in order to extract the precursor ions that match that mass
with a given ppm.

The arguments of the `import_mzxml()` functions are four:

* **file**
* **met_metadata**
* **ppm**
* ...

```{r}
# Loading the package
library(MS2extract)


# Print function arg
formals(import_mzxml)
```

### file

File should contain the name of your .mzXML file that contains MS/MS data
of  authentic standards or reference material. Here, we provide an example
file of procyanidin A2 collected in negative ionization mode with a collision
energy of 20 eV.


```{r}
# Importing  Procyanidin A2 MS/MS spectra in negative ionization mode
# and 20 eV as the collision energy
ProcA2_file <- system.file("extdata",
                        "ProcyanidinA2_neg_20eV.mzXML",
                         package = "MS2extract")
# File name
ProcA2_file
```


### met_metadata

This argument refers to the compound metadata that user need to provide in order to 
properly import scans that are related to the compound of interest.

The `met_metadata` is a data frame that has required and optional columns. The
required columns are employed to calculate the theoretical ionized *m*/*z* for a 
given formula and ionization mode. In the optional columns, we have the option
to provide a chromatographic Region Of Interest (ROI)  specifying where the 
the compound elutes in order to only keep this rentention time window.

The required columns are:

* **Formula:** A character string specifying the metabolite formula
* **Ionization_mode:** The ionization mode employed in data collection. It can be either *Positive* or *Negative*

The optional columns are: 

* **min_rt:** a double with the minimum retention time to keep (in seconds)
* **max_rt:** a double with the minimum retention time to keep (in seconds)


```{r}
# Procyanidin A2 metadata
ProcA2_data <- data.frame(Formula = "C30H24O12",Ionization_mode = "Negative",
                      min_rt = 163, max_rt = 180)
ProcA2_data
```

### ppm

ppm refers to the maximum m/z deviation from the theoretical mass. A ppm of 10
units will mean that the total allows *m*/*z* window in 20 ppm since.
By default, 10 ppm is used.


### `import_mzxml()`


With all arguments explained, we can use the `import_mzxml()` function.


```{r}
# Import Procyanidin A2 data
ProcA2_raw <- import_mzxml(ProcA2_file, met_metadata = ProcA2_data, ppm = 5)

# 24249 rows = ions detected
dim(ProcA2_raw)
```


## Extracting MS/MS spectra

Now that we have the data imported, we can proceed to extract the 
**most intense MS/MS scan** of all scans.

This function computes the MS/MS Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) 
by summing up all intensities of the MS/MS
spectra and selects the scan with the highest intensity.

This function takes three arguments:

* **spec:** the imported MS/MS spectra
* **verbose:** a boolean, if `verbose = TRUE`, the MS/MS TIC and spectra is printed, if `verbose = FALSE`, plots are not displayed
* **out_list:** a boolean, if `out_list = TRUE`, the extracted MS/MS spectra table and plots are returned as list, otherwise only the MS/MS spectra is returned as data frame.

```{r out.width="100%", out.height="100%"}
ProcA2_extracted <- extract_MS2(ProcA2_raw, verbose = TRUE, out_list = FALSE)
```


Here, we can see in the top plot of the MS2 TIC that the scan colored in red is
the most intense and the one for which the MS/MS spectra will be exported (at 170.667 s).
In the bottom plot, we can see the procyanidin A2 MS/MS spectra at rt: 170.667.
The maximum m/z axis value is > 1500 m/z but not significant ions are displayed.
This can be explained due to low intensities are kept in the MS/MS spectra.

```{r}
range(ProcA2_extracted$mz)
```


The range of the MS/MS *m*/*z* values are from 100 to 1699 *m*/*z*, but 
intensities are too low to be seen in the plot.

## Detecting masses

Similarly to the [MZmine pipeline]( http://mzmine.github.io/), 
detecting masses refers to set a minimum
signal intensity threshold value that product ions have to meet in order to be kept in the data. 
This function can also normalize the spectra ion intensity to percentage 
based on the base peak. This is a filtering step that is based on percentage of 
the base peak (most intense ion).

The three required arguments are:

* **spec:** a data frame containing the MS2 spectra.
* **normalize:** a boolean indicating if the MS2 spectra is normalized by the base peak before proceeding to filter out low intensity signals (normalize  = TRUE), if normalize = FALSE the user has to provide the minimum ion count.
* **min_int:** an integer referring to the minimum ion intensity. The value of *min_int* has to be in line if user decides to normalize the spectra or not. If the spectra is normalized, the *min_intensity* value is in percentage, otherwise the *min_intensity* value is expressed in ion count units.

By default, the normalization is set to `TRUE` and the minimum intensity is 
set to 1% to remove background noise.

```{r}
ProcA2_detected <- detect_mass(ProcA2_extracted, normalize = TRUE, min_int = 1)
```

We can see now the range of m/z values and the maximum value is 576.1221 m/z.

```{r}
range(ProcA2_detected$mz)
```

## MS/MS spectra plot 

We can proceed to plot the filtered MS/MS spectra with `plot_MS2spectra()` function.
This is a ggplot2 based function; the blue diamond refers to the precursor ion.

If we take a look to the previous MS/MS plot, there is less background noise
in this MS/MS spectra because the low intensity ions have been removed.

```{r out.width="100%"}
plot_MS2spectra(ProcA2_detected)
```


## Exporting MS/MS spectra

Finally after extracting the MS/MS spectra and removing background noise, we 
can proceed to export the MS2 in a .msp format.

For this task, we need extra information about the compound, such as 
SMILES, COLLISIONENERGY, etc.

An example of this table can be found at:

```{r warning=FALSE}
# Reading the metadata
metadata_file <- system.file("extdata",
                             "msp_metadata.csv",
                             package = "MS2extract")

metadata <- read.csv(metadata_file)
dplyr::glimpse(metadata)
```

The precursor ion is not necessary to provide since this information is included
in the extracted MS/MS spectra.


The three arguments for this function are:

* **spec:** a data frame containing the extracted MS2 spectra
* **spec_metadata:** a data frame containing the values to be including in the resulting .msp file
* **msp_name:** a string with the name of the msp file not containing (.msp) extension

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
write_msp(spec = ProcA2_detected,
          spec_metadata = metadata,
          msp_name = "Procyanidin_A2")
```


After writing the msp file, you will see the following file content:

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat(write_msp_base(ProcA2_detected, metadata) )
```



# Session info

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
