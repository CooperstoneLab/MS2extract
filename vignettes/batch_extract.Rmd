# Introduction

In the previous tutorial 
[Introduction to MS2extract package](https://cooperstonelab.github.io/MS2extract/articles/introduction.html),
we described in a detailed manner the core functions of the package. If you are starting
to use the MS2extract package with this tutorial, we encourage you to take 
a look at the aforementioned tutorial.

Now that you are familiar with the core workflow and functions of this
package, we can dive into an automated pipeline with the proposed
`batch_*()` functions.

We can remember the workflow summary where we specify the alternative of core
functions for `batch_*()` alternatives (Figure 1). Three main steps has its own
batch alternatives functions, importing mzXML files, extracting MS/MS spectra,
and detecting masses. However, exporting the database in a msp file is able to
detect if the provided spectra comes from a single mzXML file or it is a batch
set of spectra.



```{r Fig 1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Figure 1. Overview of general data processing pipeline to extract MS/MS spectra using the MS2extract package", out.width= "80%", out.height="80%", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pipeline.png")
```

## Batch functions

We are familiar with the arguments that the core functions accepts, in this
section we describe extra arguments that specific `batch_*()` functions requeire
in order to work.

### batch_import_mzxml


```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE)
library(MS2extract)
```

Similarly to `import_mzxml()` function, we need a compound metadata, with at 
lest the Compound name, Formula, Ionization mode, and optionally but 
suggested, the region of interest (*min_rt* and *max_rt*).




```{r}

# Select the csv file name and path
batch_file <- system.file("extdata", "batch_read.csv",
                          package = "MS2extract")
# Read the data frame
batch_data <- read.csv(batch_file)

# File paths for Procyanidin A2 and Rutin
ProcA2_file <- system.file("extdata",
                       "ProcyanidinA2_neg_20eV.mzXML",
                        package = "MS2extract")
Rutin_file <- system.file("extdata",
                       "Rutin_neg_20eV.mzXML",
                        package = "MS2extract")

# Add file path - User should specified the file path -
batch_data$File <- c(ProcA2_file, Rutin_file)

# Checking batch_data data frame
dplyr::glimpse(batch_data)
```

The only difference with the core `import_mzxml()` met_metadata is that you can
provide more compounds by adding rows. You can see we are working with two 
compounds, Procyanidin A2 and Rutin.

> **Tip:** you can specify multiple compounds to the same mzXML if they have different precursor ion m/z.


```{r}
batch_compounds <- batch_import_mzxml(batch_data)
```

The raw mzXML data contains:

* Procyanidin A2: 24249 ions
* Rutin: 22096 ions

```{r}
# Checking dimension by compound
purrr::map(batch_compounds, dim)
```

## batch_extract_MS2

Now that we have our data in memory, we can proceed to extract the most
intense MS/MS scan. In this case, the `batch_extract_MS2()` functions
do not have extra arguments, although most of the arguments remains fairly
similar.


```{r}
# Use extract batch extract_MS2
batch_extracted <- batch_extract_MS2(batch_compounds,
                                     verbose = TRUE,
                                     out_list = FALSE)
```

By using `verbose = TRUE`, we can display the MS/MS TIC plot as well the raw
MS/MS spectra.

## batch_detect_mass

Now that we have the raw MS/MS spectra, we are going to remove background noise
based on intensity. Again, `batch_detect_mass()` has the same arguments
than its core analogue.


```{r}
batch_mass_detected <- batch_detect_mass(batch_extracted, # Compound list
                                         normalize = TRUE, # Normalize
                                         min_int = 1) # Minimum intensity

purrr::map(batch_mass_detected, dim)
```


We see a decrease of number of ions, 38 and 4 ions for Procyanidin A2 and Rutin,
respectively.

## write_msp

In contrast with the previous batch functions, `write_msp()` is able to detect
if the user is providing a single spectra, or multiple spectra. However, the
user needs to provide information about each compound.

```{r}
# Reading batch metadata
metadata_msp_file <- system.file("extdata",
                                 "batch_msp_metadata.csv",
                                 package = "MS2extract")

metadata_msp <- read.csv(metadata_msp_file)

dplyr::glimpse(metadata_msp)
```

After having the clean MS/MS spectra and the compound metadata, we can proceed
to export them into a msp files.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
write_msp(spec = batch_mass_detected,
            spec_metadata = metadata_msp,
            msp_name = "ProcA2_Rutin_batch.msp")
```



# Session info

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
