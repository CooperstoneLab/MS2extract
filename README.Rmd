The goal of MS2extract is to create a tool to import MS2 data of known standards
or material and targeted extract the MS2 expectra in order to create an
in-house MS2 library.

## Installation

You can install the development version of MS2extract from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CooperstoneLab/MS2extract")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
library(MS2extract)
## calculating ppm range
chlorogenic_acid_pos <- 355.1023
ppm_error = 10
# Calculate ranges
ppm_range(mz = chlorogenic_acid_pos, ppm = ppm_error)
```
