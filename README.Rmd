[MS2extract website](https://cooperstonelab.github.io/MS2extract/)

The goal of MS2extract is to provide a tool to import MS/MS data of known standards
or material and targeted extract the MS/MS spectra in order to create an
in-house MS/MS library.

> This package aids the creation and automatization of in-house MS/MS libraries

> This package DOES NOT support algorithms to annotate MS/MS data

## Installation

You can install the development version of MS2extract from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CooperstoneLab/MS2extract")
```

## Example

### ppm calculation

with `ppm_range()` you can compute mass error given a ppm tolerance.

```{r example, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
library(MS2extract)
## calculating ppm range
chlorogenic_acid_pos <- 355.1023
ppm_error <- 10
# Calculate ranges
ppm_range(mz = chlorogenic_acid_pos, ppm = ppm_error)
```

### Importing `.mzXML`/`.mzML` files

You can  import `.mzXML` or `.mzML` files with the `import_mzxml()` function.
This will import MS/MS scans into a data frame. 
In this case, we are going to work with the Procyanidin A2 spectra in negative mode, with a collision energy of 20 eV.

```{r}
# File path
ProcA2_file <- system.file("extdata",
  "ProcyanidinA2_neg_20eV.mzXML",
  package = "MS2extract"
)
# Compound data
ProcA2_data <- data.frame(Formula = "C30H24O12", Ionization_mode = "Negative")

ProcA2_raw <- import_mzxml(ProcA2_file, ProcA2_data)
```

### Extracting Procyanidin A2 spectra

Here, the `.mzXML` file contains only the MS/MS scans in the retention 
time window where Procyanidin A2 elutes.
With the `extract_MS2()` function, users can detect and
extract the most intense MS/MS scan, and displays the TIC indicating which scan
is the most intense

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ProcA2_ext <- extract_MS2(ProcA2_raw, verbose = TRUE, out_list = FALSE)
```

This function returns a list, which contains the MS/MS spectra, 
and the extracted  MS/MS EIC plot.
Since the extracted MS/MS spectra contains low intensity signals (i.e. background
noise), you can remove them by using the `detect_mass()` function.

The raw MS2 spectra contains 6226 signals which the majority of them are low
intensity signals (background noise).

```{r}
dim(ProcA2_ext)
```



### Detecting masses

The objective is to remove low intensity signals, you can detect masses by
allowing normalization by the base peak and then filtering the signals by 
a minimum threshold, or detecting mass with the absolute signal intensity.

Here, we will detect masses by normalization and with a minimum intensity of 
1%

```{r}
ProcA2_detected <- detect_mass(ProcA2_ext,
  normalize = TRUE, # Allow normalization
  min_int = 1 # 1% as minimum intensity
) 

dim(ProcA2_detected)
```

Now we can see that the x-axis in the MS/MS spectra is reduced to 575 *m/z*
since the low intensity signals were removed.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot_MS2spectra(ProcA2_detected)
```


Although the resulting MS/MS spectra contains 38 signals (ions), 
we are going to include signals with an abundance greater than 10% 
relative intensity for displaying purposes

```{r}
dplyr::filter(ProcA2_detected, intensity > 10)
```

### Comparing two MS/MS spectra with cosine score

The purpose of this section is to compare two MS/MS spectra that were extracted
using this package and using PCDL, a compound library developed by Agilent.

Thus, we include the MS/MS spectra extracted with PCDL and use cosine
similarity score to compare them by the `compare_spectra()` function.
 
```{r}
# MS2 PCDL spectra
ProcA2_pcdl_fl <- system.file("extdata",
  "ProcA2_neg_20eV_PCDL.csv",
  package = "MS2extract"
)
# Reading the spectra
ProcA2_PCDL <- read.csv(ProcA2_pcdl_fl)

# Comparing both spectra
compare_spectra(ProcA2_detected, ProcA2_PCDL)
```
